INSTALL
=======
Unpack the sourceocde: (What you have propably already done, when
                        you're reading this.                     )
	tar xzvf aop-?.?.tar.gz
Change to the source directory:
	cd aop-?.?
Compile the source code:
	make
Install the binary:
	make install
Optionally, you can remove the executable (and other minor data)
from the source directory by typing:
	make clean
Play the game!
        aop
          or
	aop aop-level-1.txt .. aop-level-n.txt

You are invited to design new levels and/or
add nifty features as long as the resulting
code is still <=64 lines!

HISTORY
=======
You may ask yourself how this rather useless code accrued. Well,
here we go:

Someday, Clifford told me, that long time ago, when people used to
talk about their latest C64 games, the style to code
was slightly different to nowaday's due to hardware restrictions.
  He mentioned that he programmed a game named `Power Ballon',
which `Ambassador of Pain' tries to imitate, within 100 lines of
code and would propably need twice of this amount to do this under
modern Unix environments.

One of the following days, I programmed the said game within 97
lines of code to give proof.
  Clifford wouldn't be Clifford, if he didn't return me a modified
version with only 64 lines, immediately.

And because it's fun to play the game (isn't it?), we decided to
publish it.
